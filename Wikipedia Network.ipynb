    "No exemplo trabalhado, selecionamos uma página de artigo da Wikipédia -- \"**[Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)**\" em inglês -- objetivando encontrar as suas conexões com outros mais artigos e verbetes na plataforma. A partir dos métodos expostos, fomos capazes de extrair os hyperlinks que conectam este tópico a outros mais relacionados ao artigo original. De posse destes dados, procuramos **1)** calcular as medidas de centralidade de cada nó/vertice/página, incluindo-se algumas não presentes por padrão na biblioteca ```networkx``` (*brokering* e *bridgeness*); **2)** identificar seus módulos a partir do algoritmo de modularidade disponível pela biblioteca ```community```; e **3)** distribuir a rede e espacializá-la visualmente. Baseando-se nestes resultados, calculamos também **4)** as estatísticas gerais por módulo e centralidades médias para o conjunto de módulos e **5)** suas correlações a partir das medidas de centralidade calculadas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dessa forma, identificamos que, por exemplo, o artigo **[Empirical Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research)** tem a maior centralidade de intermediação para com todos os vértices retornados, assumindo-se como de menor distância no caminho conectando-o a outros artigos. Já ordenando-os por seus valores de centralidade de autovetor, os artigos de maior relevância que encontramos conectando-os a outros nós de destaque foram **[CURE data clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURE_algorithm)**, um algoritmo para grandes bases de dados e uma alternativa robusta ao k-means; **[Association rule learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning)**, um método de *machine learning* para descobrir relações entre variáveis; e **[DeepDream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream)**,um  programa de computação visual (CV) que utiliza redes neuras convolucionais para encontrar padrões em imagens por pareidolia, cujo efeito visual acarretou seu nome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Das comunidades identificadas pelo algoritmo de modularidade, notam-se que os **módulos 1, 14 e 9** são os de maior centralidade de grau da rede (referentes aos nós principais **[Artificial Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_networks)**; **[Deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning)** e **[Phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon)**, respectivamente), indicando-se uma maior quantidade de conexões para esses tópicos. São, portanto, *clusters* de grande índice de conexões entre si ou para com os outros, significando que encontram-se uma grande quantidade de *hyperlinks* direcionados a estes em outros artigos da rede; os demais *clusters* podem se apresentar com temáticas mais específicas, por exemplo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Por fim, determinando-se outros parâmetros na execução neste notebook, poderíamos tentar compreender as relações que outras mais temáticas possuem com outros artigos na Wikipédia, embasando dessa forma análises descritivo-exploratórias da sua rede -- concluindo-se, portanto, o nosso exemplo prático."
